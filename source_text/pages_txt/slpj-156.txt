Section 8.5 How to find types

From which we get the equations:
TO =
T1
-> T4
-> T6
T4 = T5
-> T7
T6 = 17 -> T8
T9 = TO
T3 = TO
-> T1 -> T2 -> T8
T5
=
T2
Eliminating T4 and T6, these become
TO = T1 -> T5 -> T7
T2 = T3 -> T7 -> T8
T9 = TO -> T1 -> T2 -> T8
T3 = TO
T5 = T2
Now note that these equations contain a circularity. If we try to use the last
two equations to eliminate T3 and T5, we get
TO = T1 -> T2 -> 17
= T1 -> (T3 -> 17 -> T8) -> 17
(since T5 = T2)
= T1 -> (TO -> 17 -> T8) -> T7
(since T3 = TO)
So it is clear that the type TO is not finite, and so neither is the type T9.
informally:
Nevertheless, T9 possesses an infinite type, which may be expressed
TO -> T1 -> T2-> T8
where
TO = T1 -> (TO -> T7 -> T8) -> 17
There are many difficulties in dealing with infinite types. We shall simply
avoid them by imposing the rule:
If T1 = ...T1 ..., where the type variable T1 occurs properly within the
right-hand side of the equation, then the system of equations cannot be
solved, and the expression from which the system was derived is ill-typed.
As a consequence of this, the definition in Section 2.4.2 of the fixed-point
combinator Y is ill-typed.
