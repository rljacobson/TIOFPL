Chapter 16 SK Combinators
sponding combinators. To give a concrete example, consider the lambda
abstraction
Ax. Ay . + (+ x y) x
This has the syntax tree
AX
Ay
The annotated syntax tree, together with its associated combinator represen-
tation, looks like this:
@ sc
S' C.I
@ bb
B' B +
@ cb
C' Bel
B + 1
Annotated syntax tree
Combinator representation
The combinator representation is diagrammatic, and when flattened out
looks like this:
S' C (B' B + (C' B (B + 1) 1)) !
The Is in the left-hand tree indicate leaf nodes (they are bona fide 1
combinators). Some of these Is would not be present in the compiled
combinator form because of 7-optimization, so if we convert the annotated
syntax tree to combinators we would get a slightly suboptimal combinator
expression. Notice that not all nodes have the same number of annotations;
the bottom node has only one because only x gets sent to it.
The simple equivalence between director strings and combinators
mentioned above gives a more systematic basis for the choice of combinators
we made in the first part of this chapter.
