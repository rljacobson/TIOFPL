Figure 20.13 G-code instructions for basic values
This means that the garbage collector needs to know whether an item in the
stack is a pointer or not. Unfortunately, the stack now contains both naked
and clothed values, and a naked value may be indistinguishable from a
pointer.
There are four possible solutions:
(i) Somehow mark naked values on the stack. This is tantamount to clothing
them.
(ii) Let the garbage collector treat naked basic values as pointers and treat
any structure accidentally accessible from them as in use. This risks the
garbage collector not recovering some store. All 'pointers' should also be
checked to see that they point into the heap, in order to avoid memory
protection faults and reduce fruitless 'pointer' chasing. This method is
successfully used in the SASL system.
(iii) Use two stacks instead of one, a stack V for naked values and the spine
stack S for clothed values. It is easy to decide, for each instruction, which
stack is referred to. The instructions GET and MKINT transfer values
between stacks in either direction. The trouble with this is that we need
yet another stack.
(iv) Stack naked values on the dump! This is a clever trick, used by the
Chalmers G-machine. It is based on two premises:
(a) The garbage collector does not need to follow pointers from the
dump, since all accessible store can be marked from the spine stack
(or rather all the spine stacks which are sitting on top of each other).
Hence naked values on the dump pose no problem.
(b) At the moments when we want to restore the old stack and code
pointers from the dump, or refer to the old stack pointer to check
whether the present supercombinator has enough arguments, there
are no naked basic values on the dump.
