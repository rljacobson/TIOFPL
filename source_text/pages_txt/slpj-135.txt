Chapter 7 List Comprehensions
This translation scheme is quite efficient, but there is room for further
expression
improvement. For instance, the example shown in Figure 7.3 contains the
APPEND (IF (odd x) (CONS (square x) NIL) NIL) (h us')
and it would have been more efficient to generate the equivalent expression
IF (odd x) (CONS (square x) (h us')) (h us')
instead.
In general, it would be desirable to eliminate all calls of APPEND. The
reason for this is simple: rather than generating two lists and then appending
them, it is better to generate the desired list directly. This will be significantly
more efficient, since evaluating APPEND requires time and space proportional
to the length of its first argument.
Surprisingly, it is indeed always possible to translate list comprehensions in
such a way that APPEND does not appear in the final result. The second, and
final, improvement in the translation scheme will be derived by applying
program transformation methods to the first scheme to eliminate all appear-
ances of APPEND.
Observe that the only place that APPEND appears in the current translation
scheme is in the following phrase in the improved rule:
APPEND TE[[ [E ( Q] ]] (h us')
This suggests that we might define a new translation scheme that will translate
the above expression directly. That is, we wish to define a new translation
scheme TQ, such that
TQ[ [E | Q] ++ L ] = APPEND TE[[ [E ( Q] I TEI L I
(7.1)
for any expression E, list of qualifiers Q and list-valued expression L. Then we
can replace the previous expression by:
TQI [E : Q] ++ (h us') I
It is easy to prove this is equivalent to the previous expression using rule (7.1).
The rules defining TQ are given in Figure 7.4. Readers familiar with
program transformation will see that it is easy to derive the new rules (A), (B)
and (C) from the modified rule (a), and rules (b) and (c). For example, here is
the derivation of rule (C):
TQ[ [E I ] ++ LI
APPEND TE[[ [E ! ] ] TE[ L I
APPEND (CONS TEI[ E ]| NIL) TE[[ L I
(by (7.1))
CONS TE[[ E ]] TEI[ L I
(by rule (c))
(by definition of APPEND)
The derivation of the other rules is not much harder, and is left as an exercise
for the interested reader.
