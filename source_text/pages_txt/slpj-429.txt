AN INTRODUCTION TO MIRANDA
David Turner
Miranda is a strongly typed functional language based on higher-order recursion
equations. The basic ideas of Miranda are taken from the earlier languages SASL
[Turner, 1976; Richards, 1984] and KRC [Turner, 1982], with the addition of a type
discipline essentially the same as that of ML [Gordon et al., 1979]. The Miranda system
is a product of Research Software Limited, and is implemented on a variety of
computers, running under the Unix operating system.+ A full description of the
language and its programming environment is in preparation. We give here a very brief
introduction to the language, concentrating on those features which are needed to
follow the use of Miranda notation in this book. We omit discussion of a number of
features of the language which are not relevant to the material covered in the book.
Basic Ideas
The Miranda programming language is purely functional - there are no side-effects or
imperative features of any kind. A program (actually we don't call it a program, we call
it a 'script') is a collection of equations defining various functions and data structures
script:
which we are interested in computing. Here is a very simple example of a Miranda
Z = sq x / sq y
sq n =n* n
x =a+b
y = a
- b
a = 10
b =
5
The Miranda system is interactive, and its basic action is to evaluate expressions in
the environment of the current script. So typing z to the system after the above script
had been entered would produce the response 9.
Notice that Miranda scripts have very little by way of excess syntactic baggage -
