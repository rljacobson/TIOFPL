STORAGE MANAGEMENT AND
GARBAGE COLLECTION
As mentioned in Chapter 10, a graph reducer requires the support of a storage
management system which allocates cells on request, and recovers garbage
cells for subsequent re-use. Storage management and garbage collection is a
subject on which there is a large literature. Cohen [1981] gives an excellent
survey with a comprehensive list of references.
The purpose of this chapter is to sketch the standard algorithms, to give an
assessment of their characteristics, and to make a brief survey of more
recently developed techniques.
17.1 Criteria for Assessing a Storage Manager
When considering a garbage collection technique it is helpful to keep in mind
the criteria against which it should be assessed. The main ones are:
(i) What are its overheads (in space and time)? All garbage collection
systems consume resources, both in the form of per-cell extra storage
requirements and in the CPU cycles taken to perform the collection.
(ii) Does it support compaction? If a storage manager repeatedly allocates,
recovers and re-allocates variable-sized cells, the free storage tends to
become fragmented into many small separate blocks. This can mean that
a cell cannot be allocated because no free block is large enough, even
though the total free storage is adequate. This phenomenon is known as
storage fragmentation [Knuth, 1976], and it can only be avoided by
periodically compacting all the cells together at one end of the address
space, so as to produce a large contiguous free area from which to
