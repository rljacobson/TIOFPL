Chapter 5 Efficient Compilation of Pattern-matching
DEFINITION
A set of equations is uniform if one of the following three conditions holds:
(i) either, all equations begin with a variable pattern, and applying the
variable rule (of Section 5.2.2) yields a new set of equations that is
also uniform
(ii) or, all equations begin with a constructor pattern, and applying the
constructor rule (of Section 5.2.3) yields new sets of equations that
are all also uniform;
(iii) or, all equations have an empty list of patterns, so the empty rule (of
Section 5.2.4) applies, and there is at most one equation in the set.
That is, a set of equations is uniform if it can be compiled without using the
mixture rule (of Section 5.2.6), and if the empty rule is only applied to sets
containing zero or one equations. (It is easy for the reader to check that when
the empty rule is applied to more than one equation, the order is relevant.)
Such equation sets are called 'uniform' because all equations must begin the
same way, either with a variable pattern or a constructor pattern, whereas the
mixture rule applies when some equations begin with variable patterns and
some with constructor patterns.
It is not difficult to prove the following:
THEOREM
If a definition is uniform, changing the order of the equations does not
change the meaning of the definition.
The proof is a straightforward induction, and is similar in structure to the
proof of correctness of the pattern-matching compiler that was outlined
(along with its definition) in Section 5.2.
This shows that being uniform is a sufficient condition for the order of the
equations not to matter. It is not a necessary condition, as is shown by the
function dummy:
dummy [] = 1
dummy xs = 1, xs = []
Clearly, dummy is not uniform, but the order of the equations does not matter.
However, the following result shows that being uniform is indeed necessary if
one considers only the left-hand sides:
THEOREM
If the left-hand sides of a definition are such that the order of the equations
does not matter (regardless of the right-hand sides or condition parts of
the equations), the definition is uniform.
