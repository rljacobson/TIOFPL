Chapter Il Selecting the Next Redex
11.3.1 Weak Head Normal Form
To express this idea precisely we need to introduce a new definition:
DEFINITION
is of the form
A lambda expression is in weak head normal form (WHNF) if and only if it
F E1 E2 . .. En
where n 2 0;
and
either F is a variable or data object
or F is a lambda abstraction or built-in function
and (F E1 E2 ... Em) is not a redex for any men.
form.
An expression has no top-level redex if and only if it is in weak head normal
For example, the following expressions are in weak head normal form:
3
A CONS cell
+ (- 4 3)
(Ax. + 5 1)
top-level + does not have enough arguments
not applied to anything
The last two examples are in weak head normal form, but not in normal form,
since they contain inner redexes. Weak head normal form is often confused
with head normal form; this point is discussed at the end of the section.
Our reduction order is therefore to reduce the top-level redex (there can
like this:
only be one such) until weak head normal form is reached. We can think of it
Original expression
Normal order reductions
of top-level redexes
Weak head normal form (no top-level redexes)
Normal order reductions
of inner redexes
Normal form (no redexes at all)
We pursue normal order reduction, but stop at WHNF rather than
proceeding all the way to normal form. This is an essential ingredient of lazy
evaluation, since reducing through to normal form risks performing unneces
sary reductions.
