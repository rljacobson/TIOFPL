Chapter 2 The Lambda Calculus
2.2.2.1 Simple examples of beta-reduction
The formal parameter may occur several times in the body:
(Ax. + x x) 5 - + 5 5
10
Equally, there may be no occurrences of the formal parameter in the body:
(Ax. 3) 5 -, 3
In this case there are no occurrences of the formal parameter (x) for which the
argument (5) should be substituted, so the argument is discarded unused.
abstraction:
The body of a lambda abstraction may consist of another lambda
(Ax . (Ay . - y x)) 4 5
- (Ay: - y 4) 5
- 5 4
Notice that, when constructing an instance of the body of the Ax abstraction,
we copy the entire body including the embedded Ay abstraction (while
substituting for x, of course). Here we see currying in action: the application
of the Ax abstraction returned a function (the Ay abstraction) as its result,
which when applied yielded the result (- 5 4).
We often abbreviate
(Ax. (Ay . E))
to
(Ax. Ay . E)
Functions can be arguments too:
(Af.f 3) (Ax. + x 1) - (Ax. + x 1) 3
t T
+ 3 1
4
An instance of the Ax abstraction is substituted for f wherever f appears in the
body of the Af abstraction.
2.2.2.2 Naming
example
Some slight care is needed when formal parameter names are not unique. For
(Ax. (Ax. + (- x 1)) x 3) 9
(Ax. + (- x 1)) 9 3
11
+ (- 9 1) 3
Notice that we did not substitute for the inner x in the first reduction, because
it was shielded by the enclosing Ax; that is, the inner occurrence of x is not free
in the body of the outer Ax abstraction.
