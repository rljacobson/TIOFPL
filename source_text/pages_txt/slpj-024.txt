It turns out that this small formal base is sufficient to build a large and complex
theory of interconvertibility; the standard work is Barendregt [1984]. While
this book is very well written, it is not intended for the casual reader, and Stoy
[1981] gives a less comprehensive but more readable treatment. Curry and
Feys also give a clear account of the historical origins and basic properties of
the lambda calculus {Curry and Feys, 1958]. The lambda calculus was
originally invented by Church [1941].
We will not take the lambda calculus any further as an end in itself; rather
we will simply appropriate the fruits of the theory as and when we need them.
a-conversion:
if y is not free in E then
(AX. E) + (Ay . Ely/x])
a
B-conversion:
(\X. E) M + E[M/x]
m-conversion:
if x is not free in E
and E denotes a function then
(XX. E x) - E
When used left to right, the B and n rules are called reductions, and may be
written with a '- ' arrow.

2.3 Reduction Order
If an expression contains no redexes then evaluation is complete, and the
expression is said to be in normal form. So the evaluation of an expression
consists of successively reducing redexes until the expression is in normal
form.
However, an expression may contain more than one redex, so reduction
can proceed by alternative routes. For example, the expression
(+ (* 3 4) (* 7 8)) can be reduced to normal form with the sequence
(+ (* 3 4) (* 7 8))
(+ 12 (* 7 8))
(+ 12 56)
68
or the sequence
(+ (* 3 4) (* 7 8))
(+ (* 3 4) 56)
(+ 12 56)
68
