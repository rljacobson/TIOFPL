Chapter 19 G-code - Definition and Implementation
Finally, we say what the BEGIN instruction does, which initializes the
machine:
<O, S, G, BEGIN:C, D> => <0, [], [], C, []>
BEGIN simply initializes the stack, graph and dump to be empty, and then runs
the rest of the code C.
19.1.4 Remarks about G-code
This way of defining the meaning of G-code is very similar to that used by
Landin [1964] to describe the SECD machine; indeed, the G-machine could
almost be called the SGCD machine. This is our first hint that the execution of
functional programs by graph reduction (as in the G-machine) and by delayed
substitution (as in the SECD machine) is not as different as at first appears; a
topic we will return to later.
19.2 Implementation
We now begin a discussion of how to implement the abstract machine defined
by G-code on a concrete machine (the target machine). To start with, we have
to provide concrete representations for each of the four components of the
G-machine state <S, G, C, D>, which we do in this section.
For the sake of definiteness we will study the Chalmers G-machine
implementation, which generates machine code (the target code) for a VAX.
Some familiarity with VAX machine code is useful in what follows, so we
digress briefly to summarize the knowledge required.
19.2.1 VAX Unix Assembler Syntax
Here is an example of a typical instruction we may generate:
movl 12(%EP),-(%EP)
The movl is the VAX instruction to move a four-byte word. The source is
12(%EP), and uses indexed addressing, so that the address of the operand is
the contents of register EP plus 12. The destination is -(%EP) and uses indirect
addressing with pre-decrement.
The notation %EP stands for a register, and the symbol EP should be
previously defined by an assembler directive:
.set EP, 10
Registers can also be referred to by the notation ro for register 0, r1 for register
1 and so on.
The moval instruction (Move Address) moves the address of the source
operand into the destination, rather than moving the source operand itself as
movl does. For example,
moval 4(%EP), r0
