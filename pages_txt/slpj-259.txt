It does not look as if a partial application of f can be shared. But if a partial
application of g is shared we will abstract (f x) as an MFE from the Ay
abstraction in g, so then the partial application of f is shared.
Discovering information about sharing is potentially very difficult (it seems
to be another application of abstract interpretation; see Chapter 22), but the
saving grace is that we can give up at any time and assume that a partial
application may be shared. The details are beyond the scope of this book but
algorithms.
