Section 22.1 Abstract interpretation
381
The hard way to find the sign of this number is to perform the two
multiplications in full and look at the sign of the result, like this:
34*(-5)*(-3993)
evaluate
take
678810
sign
PLUS
A simpler method is to perform a more abstract calculation:
PLUS *% MINUS *% MINUS = PLUS
We replace each number with an abstract representation (its sign), and
replace the multiplication operator with an abstract operator *%, which
implements the familiar 'rule of signs'.
PLUS *% PLUS = PLUS
MINUS *% PLUS
= MINUS
PLUS #% MINUS = MINUS
MINUS *% MINUS = PLUS
Now it is easy to compute the answer 'PLUS', which tells us that the result of
the original calculation would have been positive. We can think of this
'short-cut' in the following way:
34*(-5)*(-3993)
evaluate
rule of signs
take
678810
sign
PLUS
The rule of signs gives a short-cut from arithmetic expressions to the sign of
their value, without going via a full evaluation. This is precisely what abstract
interpretation is all about.
Let us now generalize the diagram, to show more clearly what is going on:
